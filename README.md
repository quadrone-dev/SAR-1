This is a log of my drone project. I update with new info about the direction of the project and new achievements.
- The final goal is to create a drone that can consistently recognise humans that are stranded / need help, using AI to recognise distress signals or patterns formed on the ground
- I am using python and a raspberry pi 5 for the AI functionality, and a webcam for the computer vision
- I am using OpenCV and fast.ai
